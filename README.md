# init.vim
My own personal neovim configuration, with a focus on simplicity and rigorous abuse of a `<space>` `<leader>`. Meant to be cloned right into `~/.config` on new computers, distros and servers, with minimal setup and finicking.

## Dependencies
- vim-plug
- cmake
- neovim (with all optional dependencies such as python) 

Ensure all of these are installed before using.
